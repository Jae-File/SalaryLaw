## Dilbert's Salary Law: Engineers Vs. Managers 
 
Engineers and scientists will never make as much money as business 
managers. Now we have a mathematical proof that explains why 
this is true: 
 
##### Postulate 1:  Knowledge is Power. (K = P)
##### Postulate 2:  Time is Money. (T = M)
 
As every engineer knows, 
 
       Work                   W
      ------ = Power         --- = P
       Time                   T
 
Since Knowledge = Power (K = P), and Time = Money (T = M),  we have: 
 
       Work                      W
      ------- = Knowledge       --- = K
       Money                     M
 
Solving for Money, we get: 
 
         Work                      W
      ----------- = Money         --- = M
       Knowledge                   K
 
Therefore, as Knowledge approaches zero, Money approaches infinity 
regardless of the amount of Work done. 
 
**Conclusion:  The Less you Know, the More you Make.**
      
_Note: It has been speculated that the reason why Bill Gates dropped 
out of Harvard's math program was because he stumbled upon this proof 
as an undergraduate, and dedicated the rest of his career to the 
pursuit of ignorance._
